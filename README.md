# UMLS RRF Files to SQLite Converter  

## Description:
These PS scripts will generate a SQLite Database with the RRF files from UMLS and RxNorm. 

The base UMLS and RxNorm outputs include raw files and autogenerated scripts to create MySQL databases. However some customization and alteration is required to use SQLite and run locally on a Windows machine. These scripts leverage a variant developed at the Boston Childrens Hospital Computational Health Informatics Program.
